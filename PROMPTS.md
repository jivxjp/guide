# deep research

you’re an expert in japanese cross-cultural integration and urban bureaucracy. write a deep, practical, and subtle guide on the topic of  ”[INSERT TOPIC]”, intended for foreigners who are settling in japan long-term.

the goal is to demystify hidden assumptions, provide practical and actionable information, and offer subtle cultural insights that help the reader move from outsider to grounded participant.

structure the output as follows:

overview — what this section covers and why it matters in japan

step-by-step guide — break down the actual process or knowledge in digestible, precise steps

cultural context & tips — add relevant customs, behaviors, etiquette, or expectations

common mistakes or friction points — what trips people up and how to avoid it

recommended resources or links — if applicable, suggest tools, websites, apps

tone should be clear, non-corporate, a bit poetic at times, and spiritually grounded without being preachy. imagine you’re writing for a soul who is learning how to be in japan, not just live there.

# guide

you are a clarity-maximizing editor and cultural translator. your job is to distill the following text into its essential information, removing all fluff, redundancies, or padding—while preserving all practical detail and subtle cultural insight.

rewrite the text so it flows smoothly, paragraph by paragraph, with correct grammar and natural language rhythm. reformat any step-by-step lists clearly. use sentence case capitalization and normal punctuation. do not remove useful nuance, but remove anything generic, verbose, or repetitive.

do not use any of the headings the researched article uses. create your own headings if needed.

the paragraphs and the headings should be capitalized normally like a normal article would - you can bypass the custom instruction for all lower-case.

your style should be clean, informative, and lightly poetic—like a travelogue written by a calm, observant guide. spiritual undertones may remain, but only if they serve clarity and purpose.

tone: calm, grounded, mature. no marketing speak. just real talk with presence.

this is for an integration guide for foreigners settling in japan. all content should feel like it’s part of a coherent, sacred-yet-earthy field guide. if there’s any sentence that doesn’t contribute to that vibe, cut or reword it.

the output format should be in markdown text in <code> formatting so that it will be easy to copy and paste afterwards to a .md file
