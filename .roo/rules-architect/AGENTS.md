# Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Site is configured to serve docs at root (routeBasePath: "/") so the docs folder is the primary product; additional web app code must not assume different routing.
- future.v4 flag is enabled (see [`docusaurus.config.js`](docusaurus.config.js:18)) — expect v4-specific behaviors when upgrading.
- Sidebars are autogenerated (see [`sidebars.js`](sidebars.js:17)) — moving or renaming files will immediately change navigation; use `_category_.json` + `sidebar_position` to control order.
- Global theming is via `src/css/custom.css`; component styles use CSS Modules in `*.module.css` (see [`src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.js`](src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.js:1)) — prefer these locations.
- Static assets must live under `static/` and are imported with require('@site/static/...').default in components (see [`src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.js`](src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.js:8)).
- onBrokenLinks="throw" (see [`docusaurus.config.js`](docusaurus.config.js:33)) causes CI build failures; verify links and image paths before deploy.
- Edit/preview links rely on editUrl in [`docusaurus.config.js`](docusaurus.config.js:51) — keep it pointing to the correct repo/branch for "Edit this page".
- Node >=18 is required by engines in [`package.json`](package.json:41) — CI must use node 18+.
