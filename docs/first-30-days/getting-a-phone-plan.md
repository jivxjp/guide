# Your Digital Inkan: Securing a Japanese Phone Number

## More than communication

Getting a Japanese phone number is one of the most urgent tasks for anyone settling long-term in Japan. It is not just for calls and messages—it is your modern inkan, a stamp of legitimacy in a society where systems interlock quietly and tightly.

Without a local number, you can’t open a bank account. Without a bank account, you can’t get a phone plan. Without either, renting an apartment, signing up for mobile payments, accessing government services, or registering for platforms like Amazon or LINE Pay becomes difficult or impossible. Even your My Number login and many online verifications require SMS to a Japanese number.

This loop—phone, bank, address—is the infamous “Documentation Triangle.” It’s Japan’s quiet test of your staying power, designed not out of cruelty but order. A working number signals to landlords, employers, and systems that a mobile carrier has already done the background checks. It’s proof you’re anchored.

The good news is that this loop can be broken—with strategy, timing, and the right first steps.

## Preparing before you land

### Make sure your phone will work

First, ensure your phone is unlocked and compatible with Japan’s networks. Many travelers overlook this and get stuck immediately.

- **Unlock status:**
    - iPhone: Settings > General > About > “Carrier Lock” should say “No SIM restrictions.”
    - Android: Try manually scanning for networks in Mobile Settings. Better yet, confirm with your home carrier and request an unlock.

- **Network compatibility:**
  Japan has phased out 2G and is sunsetting 3G. Your phone needs solid 4G/LTE and ideally 5G support.

- **Critical frequencies:**
    - Band 1 (2100MHz): primary urban band.
    - Band 19 (800MHz): essential for rural areas and indoors (especially on NTT Docomo).

Check your phone’s model on frequency checkers like Kimovil to confirm full compatibility.

## Breaking the catch-22

There’s a precise order to unlock Japan’s bureaucratic maze:

1. **Secure a physical address**  
   Hotels don’t count. Use a share house, short-term rental, company housing, or a friend’s place—anywhere you can register officially.

2. **Register your address at the ward office**  
   Bring your Residence Card and passport. They’ll write your address on the back of your Zairyū Card. This is your entry ticket into Japan’s systems.

3. **Get a phone number**  
   Use a “bridge provider” like Sakura Mobile or GTN Mobile. These cater to foreigners, accept international cards or cash, and don't require a Japanese bank account.

4. **Open a bank account**  
   With a local number and a registered address, you can now open an account at foreigner-friendly banks like Shinsei or Japan Post.

This methodical sequence avoids the loop and lets you move forward smoothly.

### The bridge provider strategy

Sakura and GTN exist to serve newcomers. They offer easy setup, multilingual support, and allow payment with foreign credit cards or cash at convenience stores. Use them to get started.

Once settled, port your number to a major carrier’s online-only plan. You’ll save money and gain better performance.

## Choosing your carrier

### The big three: Docomo, au, SoftBank

These legacy carriers own Japan’s network infrastructure. Their strengths:

- **Docomo**: best coverage, especially in rural areas.
- **au**: strong speeds in urban zones, frequent promotions.
- **SoftBank**: excellent city performance, English support in flagship stores.

They offer phone financing, family bundles, and in-person help. But you’ll pay for it: ¥6,000–10,000/month is common. Contracts are more flexible now, but still formal.

**Best for**: people needing physical support, new phones, or bundled family plans.

### MVNOs: cheap and flexible

MVNOs rent bandwidth from the big three and offer lower prices—¥2,000–4,000/month. But they get deprioritized during busy times, so data can slow down around noon and evenings.

- **Sakura Mobile / GTN Mobile**: tailored for foreigners, accept foreign cards, no Japanese ID required at signup. Ideal for your first month.

**Best for**: breaking the documentation triangle and surviving your first 30 days.

### Sub-brands: ahamo, povo, LINEMO

These online-only brands from the big three offer premium network quality at MVNO prices—but no in-person support.

- **ahamo (Docomo)**: 30GB for ¥2,970/month, includes international roaming (15 days in 90+ countries) and free 5-min domestic calls.
- **povo (au)**: custom “toppings” model. ¥0 base, then buy data when needed. Ideal as a secondary SIM. Setup process is difficult without Japanese fluency.
- **LINEMO (SoftBank)**: 3GB for ¥990/month or 20GB for ¥2,728. Includes LINE Giga-Free—LINE app usage doesn’t count toward your data.

**Best for**: long-term residents who are tech-savvy and want high value with low cost.

## How to apply

### What you need

Prepare these:

- **Residence Card** (with address printed on back)
- **Passport**
- **Payment method**: Japanese bank passbook or Japanese credit card. (Name must match your ID exactly.)

**Exception**: Sakura and GTN may only require your passport for initial signup.

### In-store application (Big Three + some sub-brands)

Expect formality and thoroughness. Book an appointment online first.

- Staff will walk you through everything—plan options, pricing, contract terms.
- Some stores in major cities offer English support; others use phone-based interpreters.

This is omotenashi in action: service through structure, not flexibility.

### Online application (MVNOs & sub-brands)

Faster but less forgiving. Errors often result in rejections.

**Avoid these common issues:**

- **Name mismatch**: must match exactly, including middle names and katakana.
- **Address formatting**: follow Japan’s exact order.
- **Document uploads**: front and back of cards, clear and glare-free.

#### Mini-guides:

- **ahamo**: moderately foreigner-friendly. Website has English guides. Requires photo verification of ID and face.
- **LINEMO**: Japanese-only site. Use browser translation. Requires bank payment and document uploads.

## Recommended paths

**First 30 days:**  
Use Sakura Mobile or GTN to get a number quickly. They solve the documentation triangle and get you set up fast.

**Month 2 and beyond:**  
Port your number to ahamo, LINEMO, or povo. Choose based on needs: travel (ahamo), heavy LINE use (LINEMO), or flexibility (povo).

**Need help in person?**  
Go to Docomo, au, or SoftBank stores—or their sub-brands with physical locations (Y!mobile, UQ Mobile).

## Final note

Getting a phone number isn’t just a technical task—it’s a quiet rite of passage. It’s your entry key to life in Japan: from receiving paychecks to buying groceries, from building friendships to unlocking digital services.

Do it with care, and you’ll begin to feel something shift. From outsider to participant. From visitor to resident. From floating to anchored.
