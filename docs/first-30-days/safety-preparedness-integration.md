# The First 30 Days: Safety, Preparedness, and Integration in Japan

## A grounded beginning

Arriving in Japan is not only a change of location but an initiation into a society where precision, resilience, and community shape everyday life. The first month is your time to build a foundation—learning how Japan protects itself, how neighbors support each other, and how to live with both confidence and care. Central to this is bōsai (防災), Japan’s culture of disaster prevention. More than emergency readiness, it is a philosophy of anticipation and mutual responsibility, practiced from schools to city halls. Embracing bōsai early transforms you from a vulnerable newcomer into a prepared participant in the shared fabric of safety.

## Knowing the emergency system

Japan’s public safety is layered: national emergency numbers, consultation hotlines, and local police boxes (kōban). True integration means using the right channel for the right situation—reserving emergency lines for genuine crises and relying on neighborhood support for everyday issues.

### Essential numbers

- **110 (police)**: Crimes, traffic accidents, or immediate danger.
- **119 (fire/ambulance)**: Fires and medical emergencies. State clearly at the start of the call whether it’s “Kaji desu” (fire) or “Kyūkyū desu” (medical emergency).
- **118 (coast guard)**: Accidents or emergencies at sea.

Non-emergency support:
- **#7119**: Medical consultation when unsure if an ambulance is needed. Nurses advise on urgency and direct you to open clinics (available in Tokyo and expanding elsewhere).
- **#9110**: Police consultation for non-urgent matters like scams or ongoing concerns.
- **Japan Visitor Hotline (050-3816-2787)**: 24/7 multilingual support for emergencies and travel issues.
- **TELL Lifeline (0800-300-8355)**: English-speaking mental health support.
- **Your embassy**: For lost passports, arrests, or major disasters.

### Making the call

Dispatchers will guide you through three questions:
1. **What happened?** State clearly if it’s a fire, medical emergency, crime, or accident.
2. **Where are you?** Memorize your full address in Japanese. Keep it written in your wallet and saved on your phone. If unsure, describe a nearby landmark or train station.
3. **Who are you?** Give your name and phone number.

Stay on the line until the operator says it’s okay to hang up. If you call by mistake, don’t disconnect silently—say “Machigai desu” (“It’s a mistake”).

### The neighborhood kōban

Japan has over 6,000 kōban—small police boxes near train stations and intersections. They are your first stop for non-emergencies: getting directions, filing lost-and-found reports, reporting minor crimes, or seeking advice. Even where English is limited, officers are adept at gestures, maps, and using interpreter phones. Within your first week, learn the location of the nearest kōban to your home and workplace.

## Adopting Japan’s prevention culture

Preparedness in Japan is communal. The local neighborhood association (chōnaikai or jichikai) manages drills, shares information, and stores supplies. Joining connects you to vital knowledge and relationships. Underpinning this is gaman (我慢)—the cultural norm of calm endurance during crisis. In shelters or emergencies, quiet cooperation is expected.

## Securing your living space

Most earthquake injuries come from falling objects, not building collapse. Make your home safer:

- **Anchor furniture**: Use L-brackets for tall shelves or wardrobes. Renters can use tension poles (tsuppari-bō) between furniture and ceiling. Place wedges under furniture to tilt it back and anti-slip pads under legs.
- **Secure appliances**: Use adhesive gel pads for TVs, microwaves, and computers. Install cabinet latches and apply shatterproof film to windows and glass doors.
- **Plan your layout**: Keep doorways clear. Move beds away from windows and heavy furniture. Store heavy items low, lighter items high.

## Preparing supplies: two layers

Japan’s guidance assumes you may need to evacuate or stay put. Build both:

- **Go-Bag (Hijō Mochidashi Bukuro)**: A lightweight backpack near your door with essentials for 24–72 hours—water, snacks, flashlight, radio, first aid, medications, copies of documents, small cash, sturdy shoes.
- **Stay-at-Home stockpile (Bichiku)**: Food, water, and supplies for 3–7 days. Use the “rolling stock” method—buy slightly more of everyday items and rotate them to keep stock fresh. Include a portable gas stove if your home is all-electric, emergency toilets, and extra power banks.

Adapt for children or pets with diapers, formula, pet food, and comfort items. Small touches—candy, cards, a familiar object—help maintain morale.

## Building your human network

Technology helps, but people are your strongest resource. Before disaster strikes:

- **Family plan**: Choose an out-of-area contact for everyone to call. Download NTT’s “171 Disaster Message Dial” instructions to leave or retrieve voice messages when networks are overloaded.
- **Evacuation routes**: Get your city’s bōsai map from the ward office. Identify primary and secondary routes from home, work, and schools. Walk them now to find hazards and build memory.
- **Know your shelters**: A hinan basho (避難場所) is a temporary assembly point; a hinanjo (避難所) is an indoor facility for longer stays. Know both.

Meet your neighbors and join drills. In a crisis, these connections matter more than apps.

## Acting during an earthquake

- **Drop, Cover, Hold On**: Get low, cover your head and neck, and hold onto shelter. Do not stand in doorways or run outside. Modern buildings are safer indoors than out.
- **At home**: Move away from windows and heavy furniture. If in bed, stay there and protect your head with a pillow. After the shaking stops, turn off any open flames.
- **In high-rises**: Expect long swaying—it’s by design. Stay away from windows and don’t use elevators.
- **On trains**: Hold onto straps or rails. Wait for staff instructions. Don’t force doors open.
- **Outdoors**: Move to open space away from buildings, poles, and glass. Drop low and shield your head.

## After the shaking stops

Check for injuries, gas leaks, fires, and broken glass. Open a door or window immediately to prevent being trapped by warped frames after aftershocks. Use radio or official apps for reliable information—avoid rumors. Decide calmly whether to evacuate or stay put. If near the coast after a strong quake, evacuate to high ground immediately without waiting for alerts. If leaving home, go on foot, turn off gas and electricity, and take your Go-Bag.

## Essential digital tools

Technology extends Japan’s safety net—if you set it up correctly.

- **NERV Disaster Prevention App**: Fastest, most detailed English alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and severe weather. Enable location “Always Allow” and Background App Refresh so critical alerts override silent mode.
- **Safety Tips**: Government alerts in 15 languages. A good multilingual backup.
- **NHK WORLD-JAPAN**: Official English-language news and evacuation guidance during disasters.

Communication:
- **LINE**: The default messaging app for daily life. Set it up before switching to a Japanese phone number.
- **Google Translate**: Use camera and conversation modes. Download Japanese for offline use.

Navigation and payments:
- **Google Maps**: Real-time train schedules, platform numbers, and detailed transfers.
- **Mobile Suica/Pasmo**: Add a virtual IC card to your phone’s wallet for tap-and-go travel and small purchases nationwide.
- **PayPay**: Widely used QR code payments, essential for small shops. Full features require a Japanese phone number and verified ID.

## A steady first month

Your first 30 days in Japan are a living orientation. By learning the emergency system, fortifying your home, joining local networks, and installing the right apps, you align yourself with the country’s rhythm of preparedness. This is not a checklist to rush through but an ongoing practice of presence and responsibility. In Japan, preparedness is respect—for yourself, your neighbors, and the shared life of your new home.
