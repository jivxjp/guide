    "description": "Pre-arrival prep simplifies moving abroad by guiding you through key steps: understanding visa options (like startup, cultural, student, or work), gathering essential documents (translated birth certificates, proof of income, diplomas), planning initial housing (short-term rentals or guarantor-based leases), deciding what to bring versus buy (electronics, medications, clothing), and mentally preparing with patience, humility, and adaptability for a smooth cultural transition."
