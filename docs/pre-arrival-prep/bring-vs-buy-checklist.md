# The Art of Arriving: A Grounded Guide to Bringing and Buying for Life in Japan

## Preparing to meet the unknown

Your first true dialogue with Japan begins with an open suitcase. What you choose to bring—or leave behind—is less about utility and more about intention. In Japanese thought, this is guided by two principles: **mottainai** and **ma**.

**Mottainai** expresses a sense of sacred regret for waste—not just of things, but of effort, meaning, potential. Ask yourself: is bringing this item a form of respect, or a burden? Is its absence a loss—or a chance to grow?

**Ma** is the space between, the emptiness that gives shape. Packing lightly isn’t just practical—it’s an act of faith. By leaving space, you create room for new rhythms, habits, and relationships to arise. In Japan, what’s *not* there often speaks the loudest.

This is not packing. It’s preparation for inhabiting a new way of being.

## Electronics: the bridge between worlds

### Power, frequency, and plug types

Japan runs on 100V, lower than most Western countries. Eastern Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama) uses 50Hz, while Western Japan (Kyoto, Osaka) runs at 60Hz. Most modern electronics—especially phones, laptops, chargers—support dual voltage (100–240V) and will work fine with just a plug adapter.

Avoid bringing high-wattage appliances like hair dryers or kettles. They won’t function properly and may be damaged. Buy them locally.

- **Plug type:** Type A (two flat pins) is standard. If your device has three pins, bring a 3-to-2 prong adapter.

### What to bring

- **Laptop**: Western keyboard layouts are hard to find in Japan.
- **Unlocked smartphone**: Absolutely essential. You'll need it to get a local SIM and phone number, which unlocks everything from housing to banking.

### What to buy

- Specialty electronics are better bought in Japan for access—not for price. Expect equal or higher costs than abroad. Note: Japanese phones have mandatory shutter sounds for privacy; menus may lack English unless labeled for export.

## Mobile plans and staying connected

### Before you leave

- Ensure your phone is **carrier unlocked** and supports Japan's LTE bands (especially Bands 1, 3, and 19).

### Upon arrival

- Use an **eSIM** from Airalo, Holafly, or Mobal for instant internet.
- For longer stays, **Mobal** offers plans with a Japanese number, no residence card or bank account required.

Once you receive your residence card and open a bank account, broader mobile options will become available.

## Medication and personal care: respecting local rules

### Prescription medicine

- **Bring up to a 1-month supply** in original packaging with a prescription.
- For more than 1 month, or any **injectables**, apply in advance for a **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** import certificate via Japan’s MHLW portal. This process takes time—start early.

### Strictly prohibited

- **Stimulants** (including Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine)
- **Pseudoephedrine** (Sudafed, NyQuil, Vicks inhalers)
- **Narcotics** (codeine, morphine, oxycodone) require special clearance from Japan’s Narcotics Control Department.

Bringing prohibited drugs—even with a valid foreign prescription—can result in arrest and deportation.

### OTC essentials to bring

- Trusted brands of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, antacids (Tums, Pepto-Bismol), and allergy medication **without** pseudoephedrine.
- Japan's drugstores are well-stocked but ingredients, dosages, and labeling differ. Don't learn this lesson when you're already sick.

---

## Personal care items

### What to bring

- **Deodorant**: Japanese products tend to be mild due to genetic differences in body odor. Western-style antiperspirants are rare.
- **Fluoride toothpaste**: Japan doesn’t fluoridate public water, and fluoride content in local toothpaste may be low or absent.

### What to buy

- Skincare and cosmetics are excellent. Explore brands like Biore, Senka, and the hidden treasures of Japanese drugstores.
- Be aware: many skincare products contain **bihaku** (whitening) agents, reflecting local beauty standards.

## Clothing and shoes: fit and comfort

### Sizing reality

Japanese sizes run smaller and are cut differently. Western bodies may find shoulder width, sleeve length, and hip ratios mismatched. Shoe sizes are in centimeters—bring a measuring tape and know your numbers.

Bring your measurements:
- Chest
- Waist
- Hips
- Inseam
- Foot length (cm)

### What to bring

- **Shoes**: If you wear larger than US men’s 10 or women’s 8, stock up.
- **Bras**: Sizing variety is limited.
- **Professional attire**: Suits and businesswear that fit well.

### What to buy

- Everyday wear from Uniqlo, GU, Muji, and other local brands. Japanese fashion trends often favor loose fits, which can be surprisingly forgiving.

### Where to find larger sizes

- H&M, Zara, GAP
- Uniqlo & GU (online only for extended sizes)
- Punyus (women’s streetwear), Sakazen (men’s plus-size), AOKI/Aoyama (businesswear)

## Furnishing your home: start empty, grow mindfully

### Do not ship furniture

Shipping is expensive. Western-scale furniture overwhelms Japan’s compact rooms and disrupts the **ma**—the open space that defines flexibility and harmony in a Japanese home.

### What to buy (and where)

- **Nitori**: Japan’s IKEA. Functional, affordable.
- **Muji**: Minimalist, beautiful, higher price point.
- **Recycle shops**: Hard-Off, Off-House, Second Street—great for appliances and furnishings.
- **Sayonara sales**: Facebook groups where expats sell everything before leaving.
- **100-yen shops** (Daiso, Can-do, Seria): Everything from dishes to hangers—start here.

### Sample furnishing budget

| Item                 | Used/Nitori     | Muji (Mid-Range) |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Bed frame            | ¥10,000–¥20,000  | ¥25,000–¥40,000  |
| Mattress             | ¥10,000–¥20,000  | ¥30,000–¥60,000  |
| Small table & chair  | ¥5,000–¥15,000   | ¥20,000–¥35,000  |
| Curtains             | ¥3,000–¥7,000    | ¥8,000–¥15,000   |
| Kitchenware set      | ¥2,000–¥5,000    | ¥10,000–¥20,000  |
| Microwave            | ¥5,000–¥10,000   | ¥15,000–¥30,000  |
| Refrigerator         | ¥10,000–¥20,000  | ¥25,000–¥40,000  |
| Washing machine      | ¥15,000–¥25,000  | ¥30,000–¥50,000  |

**Estimated total**: ¥60,000–¥127,000 (used) or ¥160,000–¥300,000 (new). A budget of ¥150,000–¥200,000 offers a comfortable start.

## Cultural patterns within practical choices

### Mottainai: giving objects dignity

To buy second-hand in Japan is to honor the object’s story. Practices like **kintsugi** (repairing pottery with gold) and **boro** (mending cloth over generations) express mottainai—respecting time, care, and impermanence.

When you pick up a used washing machine from a recycle shop, you're not just saving money. You're continuing a legacy of usefulness and restraint.

### Ma: the architecture of emptiness

Japanese interiors are designed for flexibility and transformation. The **fusuma** (sliding panels), the open space, the absence of clutter—this is not minimalism for aesthetics, but for function. Every item brought into your home should preserve or enhance this dynamic space.

Living with less is not deprivation. It’s adaptation to a language of space where potential breathes.

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Shipping miscalculation**: Shipping large items is rarely cost-effective. Buying locally is usually cheaper and better suited to the space.
- **Medication misstep**: Many foreign medications are illegal. Double-check ingredients. Apply for Yunyu Kakunin-sho early if needed.
- **Sizing errors**: Clothes or shoes that don’t fit become daily reminders of discomfort. Know your measurements. Bring essentials.
- **Neglecting small items**: A bad deodorant or toothpaste can quietly erode your wellbeing. Bring what your body already trusts.
