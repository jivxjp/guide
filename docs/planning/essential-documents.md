# The pilgrim’s pack: a grounded guide to your pre-arrival documents for Japan

## The paper path: not a hurdle, but a rite

Before you arrive in Japan, before the scent of tatami or the taste of ramen, there is paper. The preparation may feel bureaucratic, but it’s better understood as a quiet initiation into the Japanese worldview. The process is slow, yes—but it’s purposeful. In Japan, ambiguity is the true enemy; systems are designed to remove it through completeness, care, and form. 

The long-term visa journey unfolds in two parts:

**Act I: Certificate of Eligibility (COE)**  
Filed within Japan by your sponsor—employer, school, or spouse—the COE confirms your qualifications for residence. It takes 1–3 months, often longer.

**Act II: Visa application**  
With the COE in hand, you apply at your local Japanese embassy or consulate. This is usually a quick step, often done within 5 business days. But the COE is time-sensitive: you must enter Japan within 3 months of issuance.

Crucially, this process is not just about you. The system also evaluates your sponsor’s credibility—be it their financials, legal records, or social standing. You’re not entering alone; you’re entering with a guarantee from someone already within the system. That relationship is central.

## A map for the paper terrain

Visa documents fall into three tiers: universal basics, category-specific packets, and the deeper structure of translation and authentication.

### Universal documents for all applicants

These are your baseline. Mistakes here can delay or derail the entire process.

- **Passport**: Must be valid for your full intended stay with at least one blank page.
- **Visa application form**: Download from the MOFA site or your embassy. Fill out completely—no blanks. Use "N/A" when needed. Any inconsistency will cause issues.
- **Photographs**: Strict size and format rules vary by consulate. Typical sizes: 4×3 cm (COE), 4.5×3.5 cm or 2×2 inches (embassy). Must be taken within 6 months, white background, no shadows, hats, or filters. Glue, don’t staple.

## Building the COE packet

Your sponsor submits this on your behalf. You send them your part; they combine it with theirs.

### For work visas (engineer, humanities, international services)

- **Diploma**: Original or certified copy, often with transcripts to prove field relevance.
- **Resume / CV**: Updated, with clear dates and responsibilities.
- **Certificates of employment**: Formal letters from past jobs showing role, duties, and duration.
- **Signed contract**: Must state salary, role, location, duration.
- **Passport copy + photo**: Standard requirement.

### For spouse/child of Japanese national or PR

- **Marriage or birth certificate**: From your country. Japan prefers originals.
- **Family register (koseki tōhon)**: From your Japanese spouse, showing the relationship officially recorded.
- **Relationship questionnaire (shitsumonsho)**: Details your story—how you met, how you communicate, visits, proposal.
- **Photos together**: Natural, unedited, clear. Including family helps.
- **Communication logs**: Screenshots of ongoing chats, emails, calls.
- **Financial proof**: Sponsor’s income and tax certificates. If weak, include your own bank statements.

### For highly skilled professionals (HSP)

The HSP visa is points-based. Minimum: 70 points.

- **Degrees**: For education points.
- **Employment certificates**: For experience points.
- **Salary proof**: Contract showing income tier.
- **Achievements**: Publications, patents, licenses.
- **Language certification**: JLPT N1/N2, or BJT score.
- **Point calculation sheet**: Official form, filled out and referenced to evidence.

## Securing the foundation: authenticity, translation, and verification

### Originals vs copies

For COE, assume originals or certified copies are needed. For the visa stamp, photocopies may suffice. Always scan and copy everything before sending documents to Japan. Never mail your only original.

### Translation

If your documents aren’t in English or Japanese, translate them fully. Professional services are strongly recommended—preferably ones that issue a certificate of translation accuracy. Avoid self-translation, especially for key documents like diplomas or marriage certificates.

### Authentication (apostille or consular legalization)

Japan requires proof that your documents are genuine. The method depends on your country:

#### Path A: Apostille (for Hague Convention countries)
One-step process. The designated national authority affixes an apostille certificate.

- **USA**: Secretary of State for local docs; U.S. Department of State for federal docs.
- **UK**: FCDO Legalisation Office.
- **Canada**: Global Affairs or provincial authority.

#### Path B: Consular legalization (non-Hague members)
Multi-step process:
1. Your government authenticates the document.
2. Japanese consulate in your country legalizes it.

## Subtle harmonies: cultural context

### Paper as mirror

The way your application is presented speaks louder than what’s written. Clean formatting, aligned documents, correct paper size (A4), and no staples all suggest care. This is nemawashi—laying the roots before seeking approval. The smoother the submission, the more natural the approval becomes.

### The seal

Eventually, you’ll need a hanko—a personal stamp used in lieu of a signature. It’s not required before arrival, but knowing about it matters. It carries cultural weight and is used for banking, leases, and official acknowledgments. Foreigners typically use katakana or Romanized versions of their names.

### The human moment: etiquette at the counter

Your demeanor matters.

- Be early, organized, and self-sufficient.
- Speak gently. Use basic phrases:  
  “Sumimasen” (excuse me),  
  “Onegaishimasu” (please),  
  “Arigatou gozaimasu” (thank you).
- Stay calm, even when the system is frustrating. Anger signals immaturity and closes doors.

## Hidden currents: where people get stuck

### Inconsistency

Your name must appear exactly the same on every document. Watch out for middle initials, abbreviations, or mismatched formats.

### Financial red flags

Authorities want to see stability—not sudden deposits. A consistent record of income or proof from your sponsor is better than a single large transfer.

### Relationship scrutiny (spouse visas)

Officials watch for signs of convenience marriages: large age gaps, hasty weddings, meeting online without family interaction. Your story must be authentic, detailed, and consistent.

### Time pressure

- **COE**: Valid for 3 months only.
- **COE processing**: 1–3 months, often longer.
- **Visa stamp**: ~5–10 business days.

Don’t book flights until your visa is secured. Start early. Patience is a requirement, not a virtue.

Paper is not just paper in Japan. It is memory, intent, and precision made visible. Respect its rhythm, and it will carry you smoothly through gates that do not open easily for force, but unfold with care.
