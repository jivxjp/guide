# The Art of Arrival: A Strategic Guide to Airport Logistics for New Residents in Japan

## Preparing for your first hours

Your arrival in Japan is not just a transition; it is a ritual of integration. In the spirit of junbi (準備) — thoughtful preparation — your first steps set the tone for how you'll navigate the systems ahead. This isn't a checklist to complete; it is your first participation in the cultural rhythm of Japan. By preparing in advance, you make the invisible visible—easing your passage and honoring the people and processes that will welcome you in.

Using services like "Visit Japan Web" before landing is not just convenience. It's a signal. It says you're already listening.

## Walking the path: quarantine, immigration, and customs

### From plane to counter

After deplaning, you will pass through Quarantine. If you used the Visit Japan Web system, you'll present a QR code. Without it, expect to fill out forms.

As you walk, observe the flow: stay to the left, don’t obstruct paths with luggage, and queue in single lines. Airports are quiet places. Keep your voice low and your presence calm.

### Your residence card: first gate into life

At immigration, present your passport, visa, and Certificate of Eligibility (CoE). You’ll be fingerprinted, photographed, and—if all is in order—issued your Zairyu Card (Residence Card) on the spot.

This card is everything. It is your ID, your key to services, and your anchor in the legal system. From banking to phone contracts to health insurance, nothing moves without it. Carry it always.

### Optional but essential: student work permission

If you enter on a student visa and want to work part-time, you must apply for permission **at this immigration counter**. Bring a completed copy of the appropriate form with you (print it beforehand). If granted, your Zairyu Card will be stamped accordingly. If you forget, the process later will be slower and more complicated.

### Baggage and customs

Next: baggage claim. Find your carousel on posted displays.

Then, customs. If you have nothing to declare, use the green channel. If you used Visit Japan Web, scan your QR code at the e-Gate for faster processing. Otherwise, complete the paper form.

Duty-free limits include: up to 3 bottles (760 ml each) of alcohol, 200 cigarettes, and goods totaling under ¥200,000. Declare cash over 1 million yen.

## First lifeline: getting online

### The gap every new resident faces

To sign a mobile contract in Japan, you need three things: your Residence Card, a registered address, and a Japanese bank account. At this point, you only have the first.

So, a temporary connection is essential.

### Your options

**eSIM** (best for most):
- Digital activation via QR code.
- Can be purchased online before arrival.
- Works on unlocked, modern phones.
- Fastest and most seamless option.

**Prepaid SIM card**:
- Physical SIM purchased at airport counter or vending machine.
- Universally compatible.
- Slightly less convenient; may require APN setup.

**Pocket WiFi**:
- Portable router.
- Works with any device.
- Best for groups or locked phones.
- Bulky and expensive for solo users.

**Recommendation**: Use eSIM if your phone supports it. Choose a 30-day plan with 30–50GB of data and **no daily throttling**.

## Currency: preparing for Japan’s cash culture

Japan is still cash-reliant. Many places, especially smaller ones, won't accept cards. Aim to get ¥20,000–¥30,000 at the airport.

**ATM > Currency exchange counters**

Currency counters are convenient but costly. ATMs offer near-interbank rates, even with foreign card fees.

Use **Seven Bank** or **Japan Post Bank** ATMs. Avoid major commercial bank ATMs, which often reject foreign cards.

### ATM tips

- Withdraw larger amounts to reduce per-transaction fees.
- Both Seven Bank and Japan Post offer English menus.
- Most airport ATMs are in public arrivals areas.

### A cultural note: the money tray

When paying with cash, place your money in the small tray at the register (tsurisen torei). It’s not just hygiene. It creates respectful distance, allows visual confirmation, and reflects mindfulness.

## Transit card: unlock the rhythm of movement

An IC card is your daily tool for transit and small purchases.

### Choose the right one

- **Suica**: Greater Tokyo (JR East)
- **Pasmo**: Tokyo private lines
- **ICOCA**: Kansai (JR West)

All are interoperable across Japan.

### Avoid tourist cards

Tourist versions like "Welcome Suica" do not require deposits but expire in 28 days and are non-refundable. Unsuitable for residents.

### Get the real thing

Buy a **standard IC card** at station machines or JR ticket offices inside the airport. Register it as "My Suica" (or equivalent) to protect your balance if lost.

Anonymous versions work too, but can’t be recovered if misplaced.

Load with ¥2000 (¥500 deposit + ¥1500 credit). Cards can also be used in shops, vending machines, and for lockers.

### Go digital if possible

If you have a recent iPhone, you can create a digital Suica or ICOCA in Apple Wallet. It doesn’t expire, can be recharged by credit card, and links to train apps like SmartEX. This is the most convenient form, especially long-term.

## Social cues and spoken grace

### Move quietly, line up properly

- Stay to the left in hallways.
- On escalators: stand left (Tokyo), stand right (Osaka).
- Don’t cut lines (warikomi).
- Keep luggage close and out of others’ way.

### Simple phrases that travel far

- **Sumimasen** (Excuse me / Sorry)
- **Arigatou gozaimasu** (Thank you very much)
- **Onegaishimasu** (Please)
- **~ wa doko desu ka?** (Where is ~?)
- **Yoroshiku onegaishimasu**: A deep phrase, hard to translate. Means: I entrust myself to you; thank you in advance; I hope for a good relationship.

Use it when receiving your Residence Card. It marks the beginning of your life in Japan.

## Conclusion: the art of arrival

These first hours aren’t just logistics. They are your first steps into rhythm and resonance with the country.

With Residence Card, internet, yen, and IC card in hand, you exit not just the airport, but enter your new life—not as a visitor, but as a participant.

Master this entry, and the path ahead will open with greater ease.
