# The Arrival Doctrine: A Practical and Cultural Guide to Your First Day in Japan

## Entering Japan: Arrival as a Cultural Performance

Arriving in Japan for long-term settlement is more than clearing checkpoints or finding transport. It is your first visible act of integration. A successful arrival is not simply reaching your accommodation but doing so with foresight and minimal disruption to others. This guide weaves practical steps with cultural insight to help you step into Japan not as a passive traveler but as an attentive participant.

Two principles define this moment. **Junbi (準備)** is preparation—thorough planning of documents, tools, and mindset. It is both practical and inward, a way to “prepare the heart” (kokoro no junbi). **Meiwaku (迷惑)** is the avoidance of causing trouble, the invisible social contract that maintains harmony (wa). Careful preparation is the primary way to prevent meiwaku. Fumbling for papers, dragging oversized luggage, or asking for unplanned help disrupts others. Every act of readiness is a quiet sign of respect.

## Preparing Before the Flight

Japan rewards the traveler who plans carefully. Using digital systems, packing with restraint, and having essential tools ready signal competence and reduce stress on arrival.

### Pre-register your entry

The official **Visit Japan Web** portal allows you to pre-submit immigration and customs information and receive QR codes for airport processing. Create an account, enter personal details, and complete the online disembarkation and customs forms before boarding. This replaces paper forms and speeds up entry.

### Keep critical documents at hand

Carry these three items in your hand luggage, never checked baggage:
- Passport  
- Original Certificate of Eligibility (COE)  
- Visa page in the passport  

Have physical photocopies and secure digital scans as backups. Presenting documents smoothly at immigration prevents delays for both you and those behind you.

### Secure connectivity before arrival

Reliable internet from the moment you land is essential. Pre-order a **pocket Wi-Fi** or **SIM card** online for pickup at the airport. Pocket Wi-Fi supports multiple devices; SIM cards integrate into your phone. Providers such as JAL ABC, Global WiFi, and Telecomsquare have counters in major airports. SIM vending machines exist but offer no support if something goes wrong—ensure your phone is unlocked.

### Pack light to reduce friction

Japan’s stations are full of stairs and crowded trains. Oversized luggage is not just inconvenient; it causes meiwaku. Pack for the **first week**, not the first year. Most necessities are readily available locally. Deodorant is a common exception. Combine light packing with Japan’s efficient **luggage forwarding services** (takuhaibin) to travel unburdened.

### Install essential apps

- **Navigation:** Google Maps for walking; Japan Transit Planner (Jorudan) or Japan Travel (Navitime) for transit routes, fares, platforms, and optimal train cars.  
- **Translation:** Google Translate with offline Japanese dictionary downloaded.  
- **Food:** An English-friendly restaurant guide such as Gurunavi for first meals.  

These apps reduce confusion and help you move with confidence.

## Moving Through the Airport

Japan issues resident status at the airport itself, a rarity worldwide. This front-loads your legal obligations and sets an immediate timeline for civic integration.

### The entry sequence

Airports such as Narita, Haneda, and Kansai follow a clear flow:
1. **Quarantine:** Submit health declaration via paper or QR code.  
2. **Immigration:** Present passport, visa, and COE.  
3. **Baggage claim:** Collect checked luggage.  
4. **Customs:** Show customs declaration or QR code.  

### Receiving your residence card (Zairyū Card)

At immigration, fingerprints and a photo are taken. If you are entering on a mid- to long-term visa (over three months) through a major airport, you will receive your **Residence Card (在留カード)** immediately. Smaller ports issue a landing permission seal, and the card is mailed after local address registration.

This card is your primary ID in Japan. It lists your name, nationality, address, status of residence, and period of stay, and must be carried at all times by anyone 16 or older. Students and dependents can apply here for permission to work part-time (up to 28 hours/week), saving a later trip to immigration.

### Customs clearance

All passengers must submit a customs declaration, even with nothing to declare. The fastest option is scanning your passport and QR code at an electronic gate. Those with goods to declare or selected for inspection go to a customs officer.

## Equipping Yourself in the Arrivals Hall

The arrivals hall is a transitional hub where you can handle money, connectivity, and luggage before entering the city. Within steps of customs you will find ATMs, Wi-Fi counters, and luggage forwarding services.

### Secure cash

Cash is still essential for small purchases and transport. Airport ATMs operated by **Seven Bank** and **Japan Post Bank** are widely compatible with international cards. Be mindful of withdrawal limits (some cap at ¥30,000 per transaction). Currency exchange counters exist but often have poorer rates. Withdraw enough for the first day or two.

### Activate connectivity

Pick up your pre-ordered SIM or pocket Wi-Fi at provider counters such as JAL ABC or Global WiFi. Without a reservation, you can still rent or buy on the spot. Vending machines sell SIM cards 24/7, but refunds are rare, so check your phone’s compatibility.

### Forward your luggage (takuhaibin)

Using **takuhaibin** is the single most effective way to avoid causing inconvenience. Wrestling large suitcases onto public transport is a classic foreigner mistake.  
Steps:
1. **Find the counter** for Yamato Transport (“Kuroneko”), Sagawa Express, or Japan Post (“Airport Yu-Pack”).  
2. **Fill out the waybill (伝票, denpyō):** Have your address pre-written or saved on your phone. Write in Western order: recipient name; building and room; house-block-district number; district name; city/ward; prefecture; postal code.  
3. **Specify delivery:** Standard service is usually next-day; same-day delivery is limited and has early cut-offs.  
4. **Pay at the counter:** Cash or credit accepted.  

Costs average ¥2,200–¥3,300 per suitcase from Narita to central Tokyo. Yamato offers the widest network and reliability; Sagawa emphasizes “hands-free travel” services; Japan Post is government-backed and accessible via post offices and convenience stores.

## Traveling from the Airport to the City

With luggage forwarded and connectivity established, your last logistical challenge is reaching your accommodation. Choose transport based on destination, budget, time of day, and carry-on size.

### Tokyo arrivals (Narita & Haneda)

- **Narita Express (N’EX):** Reserved seating, luggage racks with locks, direct to major JR hubs (Tokyo, Shinagawa, Shinjuku, Shibuya). ~¥3,200, 60–90 minutes. Ideal for first-time arrivals and Japan Rail Pass holders.  
- **Keisei Skyliner:** Fastest rail into Ueno/Nippori (east Tokyo), all reserved seating, dedicated luggage space. ~¥2,500, 40–55 minutes. Best for eastern Tokyo or quick Yamanote transfers.  
- **Airport Limousine Bus:** Direct to major hotels and terminals. Luggage stored under the bus. ~¥3,600, 80–120+ minutes. Best for door-to-door convenience, but slower during traffic.  

Avoid local commuter trains on arrival—they are crowded, lack luggage space, and guarantee stress.

### Kansai arrivals (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe)

- **JR Haruka Limited Express:** Fastest from KIX to Shin-Osaka and Kyoto. Ample luggage space. ~¥3,000–3,500, ~75 minutes to Kyoto. Recommended for Kyoto or Shinkansen connections.  
- **Nankai Rapi:t Limited Express:** Direct to Namba (southern Osaka). Stylish, quick. ~¥1,500, ~40 minutes.  
- **Airport Limousine Bus:** Direct to hotels and stations in Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. ~¥2,800 to Kyoto, ~100 minutes. One-seat ride but traffic-dependent.  

## Conducting Yourself in Public Transport

Japanese public transportation is a dense social environment where etiquette preserves harmony. Your first ride is your first test of integration.

- **Silence:** Keep voices low; avoid phone calls. If necessary, whisper and end quickly.  
- **Space management:** Remove backpacks and hold them in front or place on the floor. Keep luggage close and out of aisles. Do not occupy extra seats.  
- **Boarding:** Queue behind platform markings. Always let passengers exit before boarding.  
- **Priority seating:** Leave designated seats open for those in need. Vacate immediately if such a passenger boards.  

These unspoken rules are how millions share limited space without friction.

## Navigating from Station to Doorstep

Major stations like Shinjuku can be labyrinthine. Pay attention to the exit numbers in your navigation app; the right exit can save a long detour. On the street, look for **Town Block Indicator Plates (gaiku-hyōjiban)** on poles or buildings showing district and block numbers—useful confirmation you’re in the right place.

## Checking In and Becoming a Resident

At temporary housing, have your passport and booking confirmation ready for a smooth check-in. If you followed these steps, you will arrive unburdened, connected, and aligned with local expectations.

Within 14 days of establishing a residence, you must register your address at the local municipal office. This officially places you on the civic map, enabling enrollment in national health insurance and other services. It is the mandatory next chapter after your arrival.

A thoughtful arrival is your first act of citizenship-in-training. By practicing junbi to avoid meiwaku, you transform a complex journey into a calm passage—arriving not just in Japan, but into a new way of moving through the world.
