# The Art of Arrival: Your First 72 Hours in Japan

## The space between: arriving with presence

Landing in Japan isn’t the end of your journey—it’s the beginning of your transition into a different rhythm of being. The biggest mistakes made upon arrival usually stem from one impulse: the need to act quickly. This guide suggests the opposite—beginning with a pause.

This pause finds expression in the concept of **Ma (間)**—the space between things. It is not emptiness, but potential. The character combines "gate" (門) and "sun" (日), evoking light filtering through a doorway. It's the interval that allows meaning to emerge. Practicing Ma upon arrival—through stillness, attention, and humility—sets the tone for everything to come.

Japan teaches not through explanation, but through pattern, atmosphere, and quiet observation. If you try to immediately solve Japan, you’ll miss it. If you wait, it will reveal itself.

## The first hour: rituals of entry

### Immigration and the residence card

Upon arrival, proceed to immigration. Long-term visa holders (e.g. work, student, spouse) will be photographed and fingerprinted, then issued a **Residence Card (在留カード / Zairyū Card)**.

This card is your legal ID in Japan and must be carried at all times. Major airports (Narita, Haneda, Kansai, Chubu) issue it on the spot. If you arrive at a smaller port, the card will be mailed after you register your address.

This card is more than plastic—it marks your transition from *soto* (outside) to *uchi* (inside). Treat it with care.

### Withdrawing yen

Skip the airport currency exchange counters. Instead, locate a **Seven Bank (7-Bank)** or **Japan Post Bank (Yūcho)** ATM. These accept foreign cards and offer better rates.

Withdraw ¥30,000–¥50,000 to cover transport, food, and initial expenses. Japan still leans cash-heavy in many areas. Some ATMs cap withdrawals at ¥30,000 per transaction, so plan accordingly.

### Luggage forwarding (Takuhaibin)

One of the most gracious services you can use upon arrival is **Takuhaibin (宅急便)**—luggage forwarding.

At the airport arrivals hall, find the Yamato Transport (Kuroneko) counter. For ¥2,000–¥3,000 per suitcase, you can send your bags directly to your accommodation. Delivery is usually next day.

Forwarding your luggage is a physical expression of Ma—it removes burden, creates space, and lets you move through the city lightly and attentively. Avoiding crowded stations with heavy bags is your first act of respect for the public space around you.

## Your first journey: choose your entrance

Avoid taxis. They’re expensive (¥30,000+ from Narita) and isolate you from the flow you’re entering. Public transport is not only cheaper and faster—it’s your first immersion into Japan’s collective precision.

Choose your route based on where you're headed, your energy level, and how much you're carrying.

## Your first days: tuning into the field

### Learning to read the air (空気を読む)

In Japan, what is not said often matters more than what is. *Kuuki wo yomu* means “reading the air”—sensing mood, context, and unspoken norms. It's how harmony is maintained.

Observe before acting. Silence is your teacher.

- **On public transport**: Speak softly or not at all. Phone calls are taboo. Quiet is a social contract.
- **In conversation**: Don’t rush to fill pauses. Let Ma do its work. A moment of silence invites consideration.
- **With service staff**: Simple polite language (-masu / -desu forms) and non-verbal cues go far. A small bow (*eshaku*) says more than words.

Respect is shown not through volume or assertion, but restraint and attunement.

## Address registration: don’t rush

You are required to register your address within 14 days—not of landing, but of **moving into your long-term residence**.

Do not register a hotel or short-term rental. Doing so creates unnecessary bureaucratic friction: you’ll have to formally move out, then back in.

### Once you have a permanent address:

1. **Go to your ward or city office (kuyakusho / shiyakusho).**  
2. **Bring your Residence Card and passport.**  
   - For family members, also bring proof of relationship (with certified Japanese translation).  
3. **Fill out a “moving-in notification” (転入届 / tennyū todoke).**  
4. **The clerk will update your address on the back of your Residence Card.**

This registration unlocks everything else: health insurance, mobile service, banking, and your *My Number* (national ID for tax/social security).

## Essential tools: digital flow

### IC cards (Suica, Pasmo)

These rechargeable smart cards work across Japan’s trains, subways, and buses. Tap in and out. They’re also used in convenience stores and vending machines.

**Best method**: add Suica/Pasmo to Apple Wallet or Google Pay. You can recharge with foreign cards instantly.

If your phone isn’t compatible, buy a tourist version (“Welcome Suica” or “PASMO PASSPORT”) at the airport.

### Transit apps

**Google Maps**  
- Excellent for everyday navigation.  
- Includes platform numbers, fare estimates, transfer guidance.  
- Limitation: doesn’t filter for JR Pass routes.

**Japan Transit Planner (Jorudan) or NAVITIME**  
- Designed for the Japanese rail system.  
- Can filter by tourist passes, offer granular route breakdowns.  
- Use alongside Google Maps for optimal results.

## Gentle corrections: common friction points

### Mistake: rushing to act  
**Correction**: pause. Practice Ma. Let your arrival breathe.

### Mistake: speaking loudly or too often  
**Correction**: read the room. Observe silence. Speak simply, listen more.

### Mistake: asserting familiarity  
**Correction**: bow slightly. Avoid direct eye contact. Respect space.

### Mistake: early bureaucratic action  
**Correction**: wait until you have a real address. Let the system work with you.

Settling in begins not with conquering the terrain, but with attuning to it. Your first 72 hours are not a checklist—they are a ceremony. Move slowly. Read the space. Let the city speak before you speak back.
